      <description>Hey! This post is a detailed introduction to using Shader Graph - a node based shader editor for Unity that is provided for the Scriptable Render Pipelines (SRPs), including the Universal Render Pipeline (URP) and High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP). We&amp;rsquo;ll be going over how to use the tool and it&amp;rsquo;s features, not necessarily how to create shaders using it. I have other tutorial breakdowns that go over creating specific shader effects if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in that.</description>

      <description>Hello! This is a small introduction to what shaders are and how they are used when rendering graphics in Unity.
Sections :  What is a Mesh? What is a Shader? Shader Code Shader Passes Forward vs Deferred Rendering Other Types of Shaders Materials &amp;amp; Properties Setting Properties from C# Global Shader Properties Material Instances &amp;amp; Batching SRP Batcher  What is a Mesh? Before going into shaders specifically, itâ€™s important to first have a basic understanding of what a mesh is.</description>

      <description>Depth is a term used in computer graphics to refer to how far a fragment (a potential pixel) is from the camera. But it can be a bit complicated - as depth can come in different spaces/ranges, vary between platform, and vary between perspective and orthographic camera projections.

      <title>Vertex Displacement</title>

      <description>Shader Stages While fragment shaders provide colours for each fragment/pixel, we can use vertex shaders to offset the vertices of the mesh. In Shader Graph, nodes that are connected to the Master node&amp;rsquo;s Vertex ports are written to this vertex shader stage.
When attempting to connect a node between the vertex and fragment stages, they sometimes may not connect. It is usually a good idea to keep the two parts as separate as possible.</description>

      <title>Polar Coordinates</title>

      <description>When using UVs you are usually using the Cartesian coordinate system, or something similar to it at least. Pixels along the X or U axis start at 0 and increase to 1 horizontally, and the same goes for the Y or V axis but vertically. We can then offset (Add or Subtract) and scale (Multiply or Divide) these UVs to manipulate how a texture is sampled.
We can use the Polar Coordinates node to convert these Cartesian coordinates into a Polar coordinate system.</description>
